# Government Simulator - README

## Introduction

Government Simulator is a web application designed to simulate the process of proposing, voting on, and passing laws within a legislative system. Users can create political parties, propose laws, and generate simulated votes based on predefined rules. The application provides an interactive experience that models real-world government decision-making.

## Features

- **User Identification**: Generates a unique user ID stored in `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`.
- **Party Management**: Users can create and manage political parties.
- **Law Proposal**: Users can propose new laws under their registered parties.
- **Voting Simulation**: Laws are voted on by political parties based on predefined probabilities.
- **Vote Calculation & Results**: The app calculates the voting outcome and determines whether a law is approved or rejected.
- **REST API Integration**: The frontend interacts with a backend via a REST API for data management.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (for frontend development)
- **Java 17+** (for backend development)
- **Spring Boot** (for backend services)
- **MySQL/PostgreSQL** (for database management)

### Running the Backend

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the backend directory.
3. Set up the database and update application properties.
4. Run the backend using:

   ```sh
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the frontend directory.
2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React application:

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```

## How It Works

### 1. User Identification
When a user accesses the site, a unique `userId` is generated and stored in `localStorage`. If the user revisits the site, the same ID is used to persist user-related data.

### 2. Party Management
Users can create political parties associated with their `userId`. Each party has a name, a number of deputies (representatives), and belongs to a user.

### 3. Proposing Laws
Users can propose laws by selecting a political party they own. Each law has:
- A **description**
- A **proposing party**
- A **unique identifier**
- A **date proposed**

### 4. Generating Votes
When a law is submitted for voting, the system:

#### Step 1: Identify the Proposing Party
- The party that proposed the law is automatically registered as voting **IN FAVOR**.

#### Step 2: Selecting Other Parties for Voting
- A list of other parties (excluding the proposing party) is retrieved.
- Only parties that have not yet voted are considered.

#### Step 3: Vote Distribution (Randomized)
The available parties are shuffled, and votes are assigned based on predefined probabilities:

- **40% of parties vote IN FAVOR** ‚úÖ
- **35% of parties vote AGAINST** ‚ùå
- **25% of parties ABSTAIN** ‚öñÔ∏è

#### Why These Percentages?
The vote distribution is designed to mimic real-world political decision-making where:

- **40% IN FAVOR**: In legislative processes, there is often a tendency for laws to have significant support, especially if proposed by a major party.
- **35% AGAINST**: A considerable opposition exists, reflecting the nature of political disagreements where a large portion of parties reject new laws based on ideological differences.
- **25% ABSTENTION**: Some parties choose to abstain due to strategic reasons, neutrality, or lack of direct impact from the proposed law.

These values provide a realistic yet unpredictable simulation, ensuring that not all laws are passed, and that political tension and uncertainty are incorporated into the voting system.

### 5. Vote Results & Law Approval
- If the number of deputies voting **IN FAVOR** exceeds those **AGAINST**, the law is **approved**.
- Otherwise, the law is **rejected**.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, Java
- **Database:** MySQL/PostgreSQL
- **API Communication:** REST API, Axios

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Implement login/logout functionality.
- **Party Alliances**: Allow multiple parties to form alliances.
- **Historical Data**: Store past voting records for analysis.
- **UI Improvements**: Enhance the visual representation of voting outcomes.

## Conclusion
Government Simulator provides an engaging way to understand how legislative processes work. With randomized voting and a structured approval system, users can simulate real-world decision-making in a government setting. üöÄ
